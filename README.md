### 1. Create a User Model:

Start by creating a user model in your backend that includes a unique identifier for the user (e.g., user ID).
Include fields for the quiz data, such as the user's responses on each page of the quiz.
Your user model should contain fields for the quiz data, possibly organized as an array or nested structure to hold responses for each quiz page.


### 2.Handle User Signup:

Implement a signup route in your backend to handle user registration. Upon successful signup, a new user profile should be created.
When a user signs up, create a new user document in your database and assign a unique user ID to that user. This ID will be used to associate the quiz responses with the user.


### 3.Connect Quiz Pages:

When a user starts the quiz, initialize a data object that will hold the user's responses throughout the quiz.
As the user progresses through each page, store the quiz responses in the data object.
As the user progresses through the quiz pages in the frontend, store the quiz responses in the data object. This object should accumulate the responses from each page, preparing a complete set of quiz data for submission.


### 4. Handle Quiz Data in Backend:

Create routes to handle the submission of quiz data for each page using the PUT method. Each PUT request should update the data object with the user's responses for that specific page.
Create a route using the PUT method to handle the submission of quiz data for each page. Each route should update the data object with the user's responses for that specific quiz page.
For example, you can have routes like /api/quiz/page1, /api/quiz/page2, etc., to handle the PUT requests for each quiz page.

### 5. Associate with User ID:

Upon user signup, associate the accumulated quiz data with the user's profile by linking the user ID to the quiz data.
Save the complete quiz data along with the user ID in your database.
By following these steps and organizing the quiz data and user profiles in your backend, you can ensure that the user's responses from all quiz pages are connected and associated with their user ID, which can then be used to personalize their experience and display the quiz results after signup.



Here's a breakdown of how you can handle the data flow for your full stack application:

### POST for the First Page:

When the user submits the first page of the quiz, you should send a POST request to save the initial data in your backend.


### PUT for the Remaining 3 Pages:

As the user progresses through the quiz and completes each page, you'll send PUT requests to update the existing data in your backend.
Each PUT request for the subsequent pages will update the existing quiz data with the new responses provided by the user.

### POST for User Data:

Upon user signup, you should send a POST request to create a new user profile in your backend. This request will include the user's name, email, password, and any other relevant information you want to associate with the user.
Dataset Associations:

When you receive the POST request for the user data, you'll create a new user record in your database and associate the accumulated quiz data with the user. This can involve linking the user ID with the quiz data, and storing user information alongside the quiz responses.

Here's how you can structure your models:

### User Model:

The user model can contain fields such as name, email, password (hashed/salted for security), date of registration, and any other user-specific data. This model focuses on managing user authentication and profile information.


### Quiz Input Model:

The quiz input model will hold the responses collected from the user as they progress through the quiz. This model can contain fields specific to the quiz questions, such as the responses for each page, user ID (to associate the responses with the user), quiz completion status, timestamps, etc.
By separating these models, you can handle authentication, user management, and quiz data in a more organized and scalable manner.

When a user starts the quiz, you'll create a new instance of the quiz input model to store their responses. As the user progresses through the quiz, you'll update the existing quiz input instance with their additional responses for each page.

Upon user signup, you'll create a new instance of the user model to manage their authentication and profile information. This user instance will then be associated with the quiz input instance, allowing you to link the user's account with their quiz data.
